# Deep-Learning-Week5-GAN
This is part of MS Data Science Course as part of Machine Learning Deep Learning Week 5: GANs Mini-Project at University of Colorado Boulder.

The notebook consists of Problem description, Exploratory data analysis (EDA) procedure, Analysis, Build GAN model and hyper parameter tuning and comparison, results and discussion/conclusion

The project is to use GAN to generate Claude Monet style paintings from real photography and the dataset is sourced from Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/gan-getting-started
